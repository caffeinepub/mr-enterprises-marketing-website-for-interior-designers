Ensure the mobile grid remains 2 columns with centered cards, and preserve existing md:grid-cols-2 and lg:grid-cols-4 behavior. Adjust benefit card layout for icon container size/shape (rounded square), icon sizing, and vertical spacing above titles; add constraints (e.g., per-card max-width) to prevent awkward wrapping/overflow on 375px."
