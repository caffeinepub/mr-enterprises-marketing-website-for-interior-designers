## Summary
**Goal:** Update the Collections section copy and add a “Request Samples” email CTA.

**Planned changes:**
- Update the Collections section heading and subheading text to the provided copy.
- Replace the four collection cards’ titles, descriptions, and three tag pills per card to match the provided content and order.
- Add the closing line below the cards: “All collections can be customized for size, color, and project requirements.”
- Add a “Request Samples” CTA button below the closing line that uses a mailto: link to the existing CONTACT.email value so it opens the user’s email app.

**User-visible outcome:** Visitors see the updated Collections section content and can click “Request Samples” to open their email app addressed to the configured contact email.
