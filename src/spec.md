# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Update the Benefits section so a specific card title reads “Sustainable” and the benefit descriptions use justified alignment, without impacting any other page content.

**Planned changes:**
- In the Benefits section (only within `/html/body/div/div/main/section[4]/div[1]`), change the benefit card title text from “Responsible Materials” to “Sustainable”.
- In the same Benefits section scope, change the benefit description/subtext paragraphs to `text-align: justify` on mobile and desktop while keeping icons and titles centered.

**User-visible outcome:** On the Benefits section, the card previously titled “Responsible Materials” displays “Sustainable”, and the card descriptions appear justified while the icons and titles remain centered.
