# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Refine the Gallery section’s header spacing and add a clear visual separation before the next section.

**Planned changes:**
- Increase vertical spacing between the Gallery header heading (<h2>) and its subheading/description (<p>) within `/main/section[2]/div[1]` to match the Contact section’s header spacing.
- Add a horizontal divider at the bottom of the Gallery section within `/main/section[2]` to separate it from the following section.

**User-visible outcome:** The Gallery section header has more breathing room between title and description, and a visible divider appears at the bottom of the Gallery section to clearly separate it from the next section.
