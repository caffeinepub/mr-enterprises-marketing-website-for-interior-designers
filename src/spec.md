# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Update Section 3 copy and styling, and swap the Section 3 hero image to a seamless carpet texture.

**Planned changes:**
- Change the Section 3 main heading text to exactly: "Why People Choose Us !!".
- Increase the visual size of the "Capabilities" label (heading) in Section 3 without changing the list items.
- Update the Section 3 supporting/last-line paragraph to exactly: "Created in collaboration with interior designers, tailored to each space."
- Replace the Section 3 hero image with a newly generated seamless carpet texture/pattern image, and update the image alt text to describe the seamless carpet texture/pattern.

**User-visible outcome:** On the homepage, Section 3 will show the new heading and supporting line, a larger "Capabilities" label, and a seamless carpet texture image instead of the current workspace-style hero image.
