  "summary": "The diff shows significant edits to the gallery data module, including adding multiple new image entries. While some of the specified generated images (e.g., gallery-work-07 and gallery-work-08) appear to be removed, the change does not appear to be limited to removing only the six requested images, and the truncation prevents confirming all six removals and that no other gallery items were altered.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-2",
      "requirement": "Remove only the six specified `src` entries from `frontend/src/data/galleryImages.ts` so the 6 selected images no longer render, the grid reflows with no empty slots, and no other gallery elements/content are changed.",
      "reason": "The gallery data source appears to have been modified beyond deleting the six specified entries (new, non-requested images were added), which violates the constraint to apply the change ONLY to the 6 selected images. Additionally, due to truncation, it cannot be verified that all six specified `src` entries were removed and that the remaining gallery content is otherwise unchanged.",
      "evidence": [
        "frontend/src/data/galleryImages.ts (shows new entries like `WhatsApp Image 2026-02-08 at 5.43.18 PM-1.jpeg`, `Ref. Image 5.jpeg`, etc.; truncated so full list/removals cannot be fully verified)"

      "evidence": [
        "frontend/src/data/galleryImages.ts (new `src` values such as `WhatsApp Image 2026-02-08 at 5.43.18 PM-1.jpeg`, `WhatsApp Image 2026-01-07 at 10.26.52 PM.jpeg`, `Ref. Image 5.jpeg`, `Ref. Image 2.jpeg`, etc.)"
