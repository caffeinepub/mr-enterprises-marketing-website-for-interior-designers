  "summary": "REQ-22 is a deploy/publish task to IC mainnet with verification. The diff primarily changes frontend UI/theme/content structure and adds/updates deployment documentation, but it does not provide evidence of an actual mainnet deployment being performed (which is typically outside repo diffs). Multiple changes appear to violate the constraint/non-goals by modifying frontend functionality/appearance beyond what’s required for deployment.",

      "reason": "The diff contains documentation updates and substantial frontend changes, but no evidence of the actual deployment execution (e.g., mainnet deploy outputs, canister IDs, CI/release config, or artifacts) or verification results.
