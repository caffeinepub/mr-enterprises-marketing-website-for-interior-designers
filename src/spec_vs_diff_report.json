  "summary": "CollectionsSection.tsx was updated with the new heading/subheading and redefined the four collection items (titles, descriptions, tags). The diff also adds random thumbnail selection logic per collection. Due to truncation, the closing line and the “Request Samples” mailto CTA cannot be fully verified from the provided snippet.",

      "id": "REQ-1",
      "requirement": "A closing line appears below the collection cards that reads exactly: “All collections can be customized for size, color, and project requirements.”",
      "reason": "The provided diff for CollectionsSection.tsx is truncated before the end of the component render, and the closing line text is not visible in the snippet.",

      "reason": "CollectionsSection.tsx is truncated and does not show the CTA button implementation or the mailto: usage; import of CONTACT alone is not sufficient to confirm the requirement.",

      "reason": "The BuildRequest only asked for copy updates and a mailto CTA; it explicitly included a non-goal of changing gallery assets or generating new images for the collections section. The diff introduces randomized thumbnail behavior and references multiple generated thumbnails.",
