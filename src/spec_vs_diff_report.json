  "summary": "REQ-1’s visual goals (cover fit, sharp corners, full-bleed behavior) appear to be addressed via Tailwind classes, but the diff modifies more than the selected <img> element by adding/wrapping parent <div> elements and also changes unrelated project metadata files. This violates the “update ONLY the selected image element / no other elements modified” constraint, so REQ-1 is not fully met as specified.",

      "requirement": "Update ONLY the selected image element (XPath .../img[1]) in frontend/src/components/sections/CustomCarpetsCtaSection.tsx; no other elements besides the selected image element are modified.",
      "reason": "The diff adds/modifies wrapper DOM elements around the image (additional <div> with w-screen positioning, etc.), meaning changes are not limited to the selected <img> element.",
