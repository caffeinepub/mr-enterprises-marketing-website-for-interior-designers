  "summary": "GallerySection updates add explicit JPEG asset paths and introduce client-side image error tracking, but the diff does not conclusively show that all 9 images reference the required deployable \"/assets/gallery/...jpeg\" paths or that the corresponding JPEG files are present in the frontend public assets directory. Deployment/redeploy completion cannot be verified from code diffs alone.",

      "id": "REQ-31",
      "requirement": "Ensure the Gallery section references the exact, deployable static asset paths for the 9 uploaded JPEG photos (paths like \"/assets/gallery/...jpeg\") and that those files are present under the frontend public assets directory used by the current code.",
      "reason": "Only 6 of the 9 images use the \"/assets/gallery/...jpeg\" prefix; 3 images use \"/assets/...jpeg\" instead. The diff also does not show any added/moved static JPEG files under the public assets directory, so file presence cannot be confirmed from the provided changes.",
